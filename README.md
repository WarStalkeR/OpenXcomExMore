# OpenXcom + Extended + More

OpenXcom (OXC) is an open-source clone of the popular "UFO: Enemy Unknown" 
("X-COM: UFO Defense" in the USA release) and "X-COM: Terror From the Deep" 
videogames by Microprose, licensed under the GPL and written in C++ / SDL.

OpenXcom Extended (OXCE) is OXC up-to-date fork managed, improved and 
supported by Yankes and Meridian. OXCE has many additional features, modding 
capabilities and even scripts, to say the least.

OpenXcom Extended More (OXCEM) is OXCE fork managed by me. Here I implement 
all the features I desire. Sometimes they are simple, sometimes they are not.
Complete list of changes I've made so far (as well as all potential future 
plans) are listed below along with technical details on how to use them.

See more info at the [website](https://openxcom.org)
and the [wiki](https://www.ufopaedia.org/index.php/OpenXcom).

## Advanced Craft vs Hunter Killer Dogfight
**Constants values for script files (with example below):**  
`constants:`  
`  accelerationPenalty: [10, 10, 10, 10]`  
`  accelerationCoefficient: [[10, 20], [15, 35], [20, 50], [25, 70]]`  
The `accelerationPenalty` is list of acceleration penalties for
various dogfight modes: `Standoff`, `Cautious`, `Combat` and `Maneuver`.  
The `accelerationCoefficient` is list of positive and negative acceleration
coefficients for `Standoff`, `Cautious`, `Combat` and `Maneuver` modes.
**Note**: if `Craft_Acceleration >= Acceleration_Penalty` positive coefficient
is applied.  
**Formula** `Craft_Speed > HK_Speed * (1 + Acceleration_Coefficient/1000 *
(Acceleration_Penalty - Craft_Acceleration))` defines, if dogfight mode is
available versus hunter killer. It should be noted although
`Craft_Speed > HK_Speed` can be `false`, but due to high **acceleration**
it is possible to outmaneuver hunter killer. **Standoff**
defines if you can keep enemy HK at 'safe' non-firing distance. **Cautious**
defines if you get **Evasion Maneuvers** or **Cautious/Long Range** mode vs
hunter killer. **Combat** defines if you have **Standard** mode available vs
hunter killer. And **Maneuver** defines if in **Standard** mode will you be
holding enemy craft at distance of your weapons or not. Only **Disengage**
and **Postpone** behavior didn't change. They still require original
`Craft_Speed > HK_Speed` to be `true`.

## Multi-Craft Hangars, Craft Sizes and Craft Classifications
**Facility values for script files (with example below):**  
`facilities:`  
`  - type: NEW_FANCY_HANGAR`  
`    crafts: 3` Original code for sake of max backwards compatibility.  
`    craftsHidden: false` Flag to render or not render housed crafts in
base view.  
`    craftOptions:` More explanations below in **Usage** section.  
`      - {x: 2, y: -4, min: 30, max: 49, hide: false}` Rendered in base view.  
`      - {x: 2, y: -4, min: 1, max: 9, hide: true}` Always hidden in base view.  
`      - {x: 8, y: 2, min: 30, max: 49, hide: false}` Rendered in base view.  
`      - {x: 8, y: 2, min: 1, max: 9, hide: true}` Always hidden in base view.  
`      - {x: 2, y: -4, min: 0, max: 0, hide: false}` Default hangar values.  
`    optionGroups: [2, 2, 1]` Allows disconnected craft size ranges.  
**Usage**: Now it is possible to define positions of crafts in hangar (when in
base view mode) and if they are permanently hidden. Each **craftOptions** entry
consists from 5 variables: *Horizontal Offset*, *Vertical Offset*, *Craft
Minimum Size*, *Craft Maximum Size*, *Hide Craft Flag*. Or: `x, y, min, max,
hide`, where `x, y, min, max` are `int` value (with range from -2\^31 to 2\^31)
and `hide` is `bool` that be `true` or `false`. The `x, y` define render offset
in base view from facility's center. The `min, max` define which craft can be
housed in slot. The `hide` defines if craft in that specific slot will be
rendered in base view. The `0, 0` for `min, max` is backwards compatibility
option to ignore craft sizes and use classic hangar defaults. All undefined
craft slots have `0, 0` set for their `min, max`. The **optionGroups** allow
to combine into 'single' slot for multiple craft size ranges (such as in
example above: 5 slots can be only used by 3 crafts). Slot priority is always
given to the bigger crafts first.

**Craft values for script files (with example below):**  
`crafts:`  
`  - type: NEW_FANCY_CRAFT`  
`    craftSize: 12`  
This craft with size `12` can't be placed into size 11 hangar slots. But if it
uses value of `0` (default value for all craft), it can be placed into any
hangar slot. The `craftSize` variable has no bounds beside being an `int` (i.e.
from -2\^31 to 2\^31). Modders can define for themselves what craft size ranges
belongs to what craft classes. Class granulation (below) allows modders to
classify what size ranges belong to what classes.

**Craft Weapon values for script files (with example below):**  
`craftWeapons:`  
`  - type: NEW_FANCY_WEAPON`  
`    stats:`  
`      craftSize: 6`  
In this example `craftSize` of `6` means that once this weapon is equipped,
craft's size will be increased by 6. If crafts aren't allowed to change class
(via option) or has no suitable hangar slot after such change, player will
get notification that it can't be equipped.

**Craft Class values for script files (with example below):**  
`craftClasses:` is a new global value for craft class settings.  
`  sizeClassMap:`  
`    250: STR_CLASS_MAX` Size range `250` and above.  Custom upper limit.  
`    190: STR_CLASS_AIR_LARGE` Size range `190 ~ 249` for large aircrafts.  
`    130: STR_CLASS_SUB_LARGE` Size range `130 ~ 189` for large submarines.  
`    70: STR_CLASS_CAR_LARGE` Size range `70 ~ 129` for large vehicles.  
`    50: STR_CLASS_AIR_SMALL` Size range `50 ~ 69` for small aircrafts.  
`    30: STR_CLASS_SUB_SMALL` Size range `30 ~ 49` for small submarines.  
`    10: STR_CLASS_CAR_SMALL` Size range `10 ~ 29` for small vehicles.  
`    1: STR_CLASS_TEAM` Size range `1 ~ 9` for human teams.  
`    0: STR_CLASS_NA` Size `0` is compatibility value. Always leave it as is.  
`    -1: STR_CLASS_NO` Size range `-1` and below. Custom bottom limit.  
This feature allows to assigns custom strings to selected craft size ranges.
Last entry in the list, i.e. `STR_CLASS_NO` will not be rendered or shown in
Ufopaedia (Analysis will show it anyway in numerical format). In conjunction
with **optionGroups** it is possible to create hangar that can house for
example only small sub or large aircraft. The `0` value is reserved for
backwards compatibility, since all aircrafts with undefined craft size have
their `craftSize` set to `0`, but you can assign any string to it.

`  allowClassChange: false` Allows to enforce craft size changes to be within
boundaries declared in the `sizeClassMap` (i.e. you won't be able install
equipment which size stat increases size of modified craft for example from
Small Submarine-class into Small Aircraft-class). By default this enforcement
is enabled, in order to disable it, set value to `true`. If `sizeClassMap`
value isn't defined/declared, the option will be ignored.

**Constants values for script files (with example below):**    
`constants:`  
`  baseCraftListShowClass: true` defines if class column is shown in vessel
list menu that is accessible from the base view. Default value is `false`.  
`  baseCraftListClassShort: false` defines if class column uses short class
abbreviation instead of full classification name. Default value is `false`.  
`  baseShortHangarLinks: true` defines if additional 'CRAFT>' text is
hidden in the basescape, while mouse is over hangar facility with craft.
Default value is `false`.  
`  pediaFacilityLockedStats: true` defines, if amount of shown stat rows in
in Facility's Ufopaedia entries is limited via this option. Default value
is `false`, because vanilla never had more than 5 parameters.  
`  pediaFacilityRowsCutoff: 5` limits how much stat rows will be shown in
Facility's Ufopaedia entries, if option `oxcePediaFacilityLockedStats`
is enabled.  
`  pediaFacilityColOffset: 10` adjusts column in Facility's Ufopaedia entries.
Useful, if you have hangars with many types of slots. Number indicates by how
much column will be moved to the left.  

**Strings Localization Guide (with references below):**  
For each string, in localization files you need to define two entries: 
standard and short.  
`en-US:`  
`  STR_CLASS_CAR_SMALL: "Small Vehicle"`  
`  STR_CLASS_CAR_SMALL_UC: "SV"`  
Standard version will be seen in Craft's Ufopaedia entry. Short will be seen
in Facility's Ufopaedia entry (hangars only).  

## Bigger Craft Spites (for Base View and Refit Screen)
**Craft values for script files (with example below):**  
`crafts:`  
`  - type: BIG_SPRITE_CRAFT`  
`    spriteSize: [54, 72]`  
Now it is possible to define new sprite size for crafts with bigger sprites
in order to still keep them centered at original coordinates. The `spriteSize`
values should be exactly as as vertical and horizontal size of your image in
pixels. Any change to the sprite size should be even: i.e. you can't use 35x45
pixels sprite.

## Base Attack/Missile Strikes Debug Triggers
Only works when in `options.cfg` the option `debug: true` is set. In
**Geoscape**, if you hold SHIFT, while clicking any of your bases, it will
trigger base invasion with random race/faction. If you do so, whilst holding
CTRL, missile strike against selected base will be triggered.

**Note**: If your mod has no `ufos:` rules with `missilePower`, then no missile
strike will be triggered. In addition, all relevant missions, races and UFOs
should be properly linked together, so they can be triggered and spawned
normally by the game, otherwise nothing will spawn and you will get error
message in log what is missing.

## Distance to Course Target from Crafts
Allows to enable range measurement in **Geoscape** target list, when you
select 'Set The Course' option. In additional column near base name you will
get calculated range to target (by default in KM).   

**Constants values for script files (with example below):**   
`constants:`  
`  geoShowTargetCourseRange: true` defines if option is enabled or not.
Default value is `false`.  
`  geoTargetCourseRangeMult: 1.8` allows to convert default unit (KM)
into anything you want. Default value is `1.0` (for KM).  
`  geoTargetRangeColOffset: -15` allows to adjust range column to specific
localization via offset.  

**Reminder:** Please don't forget to modify `STR_BASE_DISTANCE` localization
string to ensure that it related to the chosen `geoTargetCourseRangeMult` for
correct distance measurement with new units.  

## Game Data Viewer Mode for Tech Tree Viewer
Helps to debug and analyze **Arc Scripts**, **Event Scripts** and **Mission
Scripts**. Mostly works when in `options.cfg` the option `debug: true` is set.
Once debug mode is enabled, go to Options -> Advanced -> Extended, find option
**Advanced Debugging Options**, enable it. Additional sub-section **Advanced
Debugging** will show. In it enable **Tech Tree Viewer - Data Mode**. Load
game, open Tech Tree Viewer via `Q` hotkey. Typing `ASCRIPT`, `ESCRIPT` or
`MSCRIPT` in search will list all Arc/Event/Mission scripts.  

Since it is quite spoiler-y, it can be completely disabled in mods via
`fixedUserOptions` through the `oxceTechTreeDataView: false` and
`oxceShowAdvancedDebugOptions: false` options.  

## Base Sets and New Game Starting Base Selection
**Base Set values for script files (with example below):**  
`startingBaseSets:`  
`  - name: STR_INIT_BASE_UFO_DEFENSE`  
`    baseDefault: ...`  
`    baseBeginner: ...`  
`    baseExperienced: ...`  
`    baseVeteran: ...`  
`    baseGenius: ...`  
`    baseSuperhuman: ...`  
Allows to enable option `oxceStartingBaseSelection` that in New Game interface 
that allows user to select custom starting base with different set of starting
facilities (of course if there are any beside default ones). Syntax follows
same pattern that you can observe in `startingBase`, `startingBaseGenius` and
other global variables.

**Note**: game allows to modify 1st depth YAML nodes of the `baseDefault` 
and others, just like for `startingBase` (i.e. `facilities`, `crafts`, `items` 
& etc) as whole, but because each of them is treated as raw YAML data, it
isn't converted to structure and isn't validated. Hence, modders, pay utmost
attention to the details and syntax of what you're writing. On the positive
side you can even force specific longitude and latitude for a starting base.

## Rule Flag to Hide Ufopaedia Articles by Default
**Ufopaedia article values for script files (with example below):**  
`ufopaedia:`  
`  - id: STR_HANGAR_DAMAGED`  
`    requires:`  
`      - STR_INSPECT_MACHINERY`  
`    text: STR_HANGAR_DAMAGED_UFOPEDIA`  
`    hiddenByDefault: true`  
If `hiddenByDefault` flag is enabled for the ufopaedia article, once relevant
technology (that is required by the article) is unlocked, it is automatically
moved into the 'hidden' category (which player can manage manually). This is
especially suitable to allow damaged/ruined variants of facilities to open
relevant ufopaedia article on middle mouse button click on them in the
basescape, but at the same time to prevent clutter in the ufopaedia list and
avoid of annoyance of seeing damage/ruins while browsing normally.

# OpenXcom Extended More Plans
1\. Increase craft weapons/system limit to 6 in code.  
2\. Add motion-scanner stats, similar to medikit and script integration.  
3\. Scripting links between geoscape and battlescape (i.e. fetching craft data).  
4\. Prefab kits for fast base deployment. More expensive than normal
facilities.  
5\. Crafts, UFOs and weapons altitude/depth separation and rework.  
6\. Geoscape base engagement with targets at range (similar to dogfight).  

# OpenXcom Extended More Far Fetched Plans
1\. Real-Time (with Pause) Geoscape Combat: inspired by X-COM: Apocalypse
cityscape real-time combat. But in this case it will occur on geoscape and
beside crafts vs UFOs, bases (both player's and hostile's) will join the
fray. In addition, capability for bases to shoot passing-by UFOs will add
to strategic complexity and variety.  
2\. Real-Time (with Pause) Battlescape Combat: inspired by X-COM: Apocalypse
real-time mode alternative to turn-based for battlescape. This one will be
pretty much copy-paste from X-COM: Apocalypse. The only issue is that massive
AI rework will be required to ensure that AI can handle real-time combat
just as good as player and without cheating, but by using all the tools that
player can use, such as scanners & etc.  

## Scanner Change Ideas
`scannerResolution: 2` - 1 is default one. 2 will allow you to see at
longer range, but with reduced precision.  
`scannerResolutionSwitch: True` - if `scannerResolution > 1` you can change
it during battle. Thus, you will be able to detect targets at longer range,
close up and switch resolution for precision.  
`scannerModes:` - script names of modes that will be used to calculate the
output (what you see and what you don't). Will be stored as
`std::vector<std::string>`.  
`  - SCANNER_MODE_MOTION_SCRIPT`  
`  - SCANNER_MODE_PSIONIC_SCRIPT`  
`  - SCANNER_MODE_ELECTROMAGNETIC_SCRIPT`  
`  - SCANNER_MODE_HEARTBEAT_SCRIPT`  
`  - SCANNER_MODE_DEMONIC_ENERGY_SCRIPT`  
`scannerAddDefault: true` - allows to enable default motion scanning mode in
addition to custom modes. Irrelevant, if `scannerModes` has no entries,
because it will be working in default mode anyway.  

## Altitude/Depth Rework
Separate altitude from depth. Allow crafts to have both, allow craft weapons
to have max altitude and max depth parameters. Implement different speeds for
depth and altitude (difference between underwater and aerial). Also implement
similar parameter for UFOs (especially Hunter Killers). In short, proper
implementation of a framework for different behavior in air and sea.

Maybe add proper pathfinding for the ground-only and submarine-only units (UFOs
and Crafts alike)? Implementation can be very tricky and will require flag that
Craft/UFO can't move on the ground or sea level.

## Improved Base Warfare
Base warfare will be divided into two stages: close-in base warfare (i.e. good
old base defense), when UFO is directly above the base and long-range base
warfare, when base can take down UFOs from afar. In case of the close-in mode
all encounter behavior will stay the same, but weapon handling (including ammo
consumption, damage and accuracy) will be fetched from referenced base weapon
rule used by long-range mode. Just like crafts, base defenses will require
time to reload and rearm after usage.

Long-range base warfare will be performed separately from dogfights and can't
be mixed with them. Depending on UFO mission, its behavior will change upon
being fired from base: run away (if weak or scout), proceed/ignore (when the
mission is priority) and retaliation (moving to base invasion). Any use of the
base for warfare will make it visible for the UFO that base attacks. Cloaking
device will reduce risk of exposure based on % (custom parameter). Repulsor
can be used to slow/ground the UFO based on % (custom parameter).

Base defenses still will allow default parameters for close-in, but if base
weapon rule is linked, it will fetch all behavior from it and will ignore
standard parameters. Base weapon rule will include these parameters: optimal
range, falloff range, accuracy, ammo rack size, rate of fire, salvo size,
salvo rate, countermeasure (true/false to intercept incoming projectiles),
ammo per salvo (i.e. for flak), damage (per hit), max altitude, max depth.

UFO will have new optional parameters that will allow them to retaliate for
long-range base attacks: range, rate of fire, damage (different for base
weapon damage numbers, since facilities has no health as is). Facilities
will get new parameter resistance (damage accumulates into build time and
if goes above, it will downgrade/demolish facility). Since base weapon range
is different, even if player can start battle, not all weapon will be able to
fire at UFO, just like UFO won't be able to return fire from far away.

On geoscape, once UFO within range of any weapon, player will be notified 1st
time and all weapons - 2nd time. It will be possible to enable notification,
when UFO comes within range of one more weapon. Notifications will also appear,
when UFO is about to leave range of the weapons (configurable). It will be
possible to give command to ignore this UFO completely by this base or all
bases (and let it move as it wants).

# Installation

OpenXcom requires a vanilla copy of the X-COM resources -- from either or both
of the original games.  If you own the games on Steam, the Windows installer
will automatically detect it and copy the resources over for you.

If you want to copy things over manually, you can find the Steam game folders
at:

    UFO: "Steam\SteamApps\common\XCom UFO Defense\XCOM"
    TFTD: "Steam\SteamApps\common\X-COM Terror from the Deep\TFD"

Do not use modded versions (e.g. with XcomUtil) as they may cause bugs and
crashes.  Copy the UFO subfolders to the UFO subdirectory in OpenXcom's data
or user folder and/or the TFTD subfolders to the TFTD subdirectory in OpenXcom's
data or user folder (see below for folder locations).

## Mods

Mods are an important and exciting part of the game.  OpenXcom comes with a set
of standard mods based on traditional XcomUtil and UFOExtender functionality.
There is also a [mod portal website](https://openxcom.mod.io/) with a thriving
mod community with hundreds of innovative mods to choose from.

To install a mod, go to the mods subdirectory in your user directory (see below
for folder locations).  Extract the mod into a new subdirectory.  WinZip has an
"Extract to" option that creates a directory whose name is based on the archive
name.  It doesn't really matter what the directory name is as long as it is
unique.  Some mods are packed with extra directories at the top, so you may
need to move files around inside the new mod directory to get things straighted
out.  For example, if you extract a mod to mods/LulzMod and you see something
like:

    mods/LulzMod/data/TERRAIN/
    mods/LulzMod/data/Rulesets/

and so on, just move everything up a level so it looks like:

    mods/LulzMod/TERRAIN/
    mods/LulzMod/Rulesets/

and you're good to go!  Enable your new mod on the Options -> Mods page in-game.

## Directory Locations

OpenXcom has three directory locations that it searches for user and game files:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Folder Type</th>
    <th>Folder Contents</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>user</td>
    <td>mods, savegames, screenshots</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>config</td>
    <td>game configuration</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data</td>
    <td>UFO and TFTD data files, standard mods, common resources</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each of these default to different paths on different operating systems (shown
below).  For the user and config directories, OpenXcom will search a list of
directories and use the first one that already exists.  If none exist, it will
create a directory and use that.  When searching for files in the data
directory, OpenXcom will search through all of the named directories, so some
files can be installed in one directory and others in another.  This gives
you some flexibility in case you can't copy UFO or TFTD resource files to some
system locations.  You can also specify your own path for each of these by
passing a commandline argument when running OpenXcom.  For example:

    openxcom -data "$HOME/bin/OpenXcom/usr/share/openxcom"

or, if you have a fully self-contained installation:

    openxcom -data "$HOME/games/openxcom/data" -user "$HOME/games/openxcom/user" -config "$HOME/games/openxcom/config"

in-game and out-game. These options are global and affect any old or new
savegame.

For more details please check the [wiki](https://ufopaedia.org/index.php/Options_(OpenXcom)).

## Development

OpenXcom requires the following developer libraries:

- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) (libsdl1.2)
- [SDL\_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) (libsdl-mixer1.2)
- [SDL\_gfx](https://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/) (libsdl-gfx1.2), version 2.0.22 or later
- [SDL\_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) (libsdl-image1.2)
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp), version 0.5.3 or later

The source code includes files for the following build tools:

- Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 or newer
- Xcode
- Make (see Makefile.simple)
- CMake

It's also been tested on a variety of other tools on Windows/Mac/Linux. More
detailed compiling instructions are available at the
[wiki](https://ufopaedia.org/index.php/Compiling_(OpenXcom)), along with
pre-compiled dependency packages.

## Compilation

Custom compilation instructions from under `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS x64` **VMware** virtual machine only (yes, its weird that I compile windows executable under linux, but it allows to compile everything into a single file). Current instructions for now are only for windows 64-bit executable. Later I will add instructions for linux, android and iOS as well.

**Note**: make sure that you have enabled 'OpenXcomExMore' VM shared folder and linked it to the actual path, where all OXCE related files reside, such as: `C:\Path\To\Cloned\Git\Folder\OpenXcomExMore`

If you're compiling the executable for the first time in the virtual machine, follow these instructions.

If you're re-compiling the executable after shutting down or restarting virtual machine, follow these instructions:
```
sudo vmhgfs-fuse .host:/OpenXcomExMore ~/Desktop/OpenXcomExM -o allow_other -o auto_unmount
cd ~/Desktop/OpenXcomExM/build
export PATH=/opt/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH
make -j8
/opt/mxe/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static-strip -d ~/Desktop/OpenXcomExM/build/bin/openxcom.exe
mv ~/Desktop/OpenXcomExM/build/bin/openxcom.exe ~/Desktop/OpenXcomExM/build/bin/OpenXcomExM.exe
```

If you're re-compiling the executable within the same virtual machine session, follow these instructions:
```
make -j8
/opt/mxe/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static-strip -d ~/Desktop/OpenXcomExM/build/bin/openxcom.exe
mv ~/Desktop/OpenXcomExM/build/bin/openxcom.exe ~/Desktop/OpenXcomExM/build/bin/OpenXcomExM.exe
```
